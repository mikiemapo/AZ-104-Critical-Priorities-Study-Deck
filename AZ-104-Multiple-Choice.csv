"What are the EXACT steps to configure auto-swap for Azure App Service deployment slots?

A) Create slot → Enable auto-swap → Configure warm-up → Test
B) Configure warm-up → Create slot → Enable auto-swap → Deploy  
C) Create slot → Deploy → Enable auto-swap → Configure warm-up
D) Enable auto-swap → Create slot → Configure warm-up → Deploy","A) Create slot → Enable auto-swap → Configure warm-up → Test

<strong>Correct Answer: A</strong>

The correct sequence is:
1. Create deployment slot (staging)
2. Enable Auto-Swap during slot creation OR in deployment settings
3. Configure automatic warm-up process before swap
4. Test to ensure zero-downtime deployment works

This ensures proper integration with CI/CD pipelines and fail-safe rollback capabilities.","App Service,Deployment,Critical Priority"
"You need to securely connect an App Service to Azure SQL Database. What is the CORRECT sequence?

A) Service Endpoint → VNet Integration → Firewall Rules → Disable Public Access → Test
B) VNet Integration → Service Endpoint → Firewall Rules → Disable Public Access → Test  
C) Firewall Rules → VNet Integration → Service Endpoint → Disable Public Access → Test
D) Disable Public Access → VNet Integration → Service Endpoint → Firewall Rules → Test","B) VNet Integration → Service Endpoint → Firewall Rules → Disable Public Access → Test

<strong>Correct Answer: B</strong>

The sequence is: <strong>C→A→D→B→E</strong>
- <strong>C</strong> - VNet Integration: Connect App Service to VNet subnet FIRST
- <strong>A</strong> - Service Endpoint: Enable Microsoft.Sql service endpoint
- <strong>D</strong> - Firewall Rules: Update SQL Database firewall rules  
- <strong>B</strong> - Disable Public Access: Turn off public internet access
- <strong>E</strong> - Test: Verify end-to-end secure connection

CRITICAL: Must establish VNet integration and service endpoints BEFORE disabling public access.","App Service,Security,VNet,SQL Database,Critical Priority"
"What is Azure Container Instances (ACI) scaling limitation compared to AKS?

A) ACI supports horizontal auto-scaling like AKS
B) ACI requires manual scaling by updating container specifications
C) ACI has no scaling support - containers are fixed size
D) ACI requires delete/redeploy for scaling changes","D) ACI requires delete/redeploy for scaling changes

<strong>Correct Answer: D</strong>

<strong>ACI Fundamental Limitation:</strong> NO in-place auto-scaling support

<strong>ACI Scaling Process:</strong>
1. Delete existing container group (az container delete)
2. Modify deployment template with new specs (CPU, memory, container count)  
3. Redeploy container group (az container create)

<strong>vs AKS:</strong> In-place Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) with zero downtime

Choose AKS for production workloads requiring auto-scaling.","ACI,Scaling,Containers,Critical Priority"
"What are the different Container Apps ingress configuration options?

A) Public, Private, Internal, Disabled
B) External, Internal, Disabled
C) Internet, VNet, Private, None
D) Public, VNet-only, Private, Background","B) External, Internal, Disabled

<strong>Correct Answer: B</strong>

<strong>External Ingress:</strong>
• Exposes app to internet traffic
• Provides public FQDN
• Use for: Public-facing APIs, web applications

<strong>Internal Ingress:</strong>  
• VNet-only access - no internet exposure
• Private connectivity within Container Apps Environment
• Use for: Internal microservices, backend APIs

<strong>Disabled:</strong>
• No HTTP ingress at all
• Use for: Background jobs, queue processors","Container Apps,Ingress,Networking,High Priority"
"What is the correct difference between Fault Domains and Update Domains?

A) Fault Domains = power/network failure protection, Update Domains = planned maintenance isolation
B) Fault Domains = planned maintenance isolation, Update Domains = power/network failure protection  
C) Both provide the same protection against different types of failures
D) Fault Domains are for VMs, Update Domains are for containers","A) Fault Domains = power/network failure protection, Update Domains = planned maintenance isolation

<strong>Correct Answer: A</strong>

<strong>Fault Domains (FD):</strong>
• Protection against unplanned hardware failures
• Separate power source and network switch
• Azure automatically distributes VMs across fault domains

<strong>Update Domains (UD):</strong>
• Protection during planned maintenance/updates  
• Only one update domain rebooted at a time
• Ensures service availability during Azure maintenance

<strong>Key:</strong> FD = unplanned failures, UD = planned maintenance","Azure VMs,Fault Domains,Update Domains,High Priority"
"What are the differences between VMSS Orchestration Modes?

A) Uniform = identical VMs, Flexible = mixed VM sizes and types
B) Uniform = automatic scaling, Flexible = manual scaling
C) Uniform = single VM type, Flexible = multiple availability zones  
D) No difference - both modes work identically","A) Uniform = identical VMs, Flexible = mixed VM sizes and types

<strong>Correct Answer: A</strong>

<strong>Uniform Orchestration Mode:</strong>
• All VMs must be identical (same size, image, configuration)
• Built for true scale sets with identical workloads
• Traditional VMSS behavior

<strong>Flexible Orchestration Mode:</strong>
• Mix different VM sizes and types in same scale set
• Better for heterogeneous workloads
• More flexibility in VM configuration
• Can manage existing VMs

Choose Uniform for identical workloads, Flexible for mixed requirements.","VMSS,Orchestration,Scaling,High Priority"
