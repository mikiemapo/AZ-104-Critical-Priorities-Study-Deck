"What are the EXACT steps to configure auto-swap for Azure App Service deployment slots to ensure zero-downtime deployments?","Create deployment slot → Configure warm-up → Enable auto-swap → Test","Configure warm-up → Create slot → Enable auto-swap → Deploy","Create slot → Deploy → Enable auto-swap → Configure warm-up","Enable auto-swap → Create slot → Configure warm-up → Deploy","A","<strong>Correct Answer: A) Create deployment slot → Configure warm-up → Enable auto-swap → Test</strong><br><br><strong>Step-by-Step Process:</strong><br>1. <strong>Create deployment slot</strong> (staging) in App Service<br>2. <strong>Configure warm-up</strong> during slot creation OR in deployment settings<br>3. <strong>Enable Auto-Swap</strong> to automatically swap staging to production after deployment completion<br>4. <strong>Test</strong> to ensure system performs automatic warm-up process before swap<br><br><strong>Key Benefits:</strong><br>• Zero-downtime deployment with automatic warm-up<br>• Health validation before swap<br>• Fail-safe rollback if deployment health checks fail<br>• Perfect integration with CI/CD pipelines","App Service,Deployment,Critical Priority,Auto-Swap","Microsoft Learn - App Service Deployment Slots","Critical Priorities Batch"
"You need to securely connect an App Service to Azure SQL Database. What is the CORRECT sequence to avoid connectivity loss?","VNet Integration → Service Endpoint → Firewall Rules → Disable Public Access → Test","Service Endpoint → VNet Integration → Firewall Rules → Disable Public Access → Test","Disable Public Access → VNet Integration → Service Endpoint → Firewall Rules → Test","Firewall Rules → VNet Integration → Service Endpoint → Disable Public Access → Test","A","<strong>Correct Answer: A) VNet Integration → Service Endpoint → Firewall Rules → Disable Public Access → Test</strong><br><br><strong>Critical Sequence (C→A→D→B→E):</strong><br>1. <strong>VNet Integration:</strong> Connect App Service to VNet subnet FIRST<br>2. <strong>Service Endpoint:</strong> Enable Microsoft.Sql service endpoint on the subnet<br>3. <strong>Firewall Rules:</strong> Update SQL Database firewall to allow subnet access<br>4. <strong>Disable Public Access:</strong> Turn off public internet access to SQL Database<br>5. <strong>Test:</strong> Verify end-to-end secure connection works<br><br><strong>CRITICAL:</strong> Must establish VNet integration and service endpoints BEFORE disabling public access to prevent connectivity loss","App Service,Security,VNet,SQL Database,Critical Priority","Microsoft Learn - App Service VNet Integration","Critical Priorities Batch"
"What is the complete Container Security Pipeline implementation for Azure Container Registry that ensures only secure images reach production?","Microsoft Defender for Containers only","ACR Tasks for Build Pipeline only","Azure Policy for Enforcement only","Microsoft Defender + ACR Tasks + Azure Policy (Three-Layer Approach)","D","<strong>Correct Answer: D) Microsoft Defender + ACR Tasks + Azure Policy (Three-Layer Approach)</strong><br><br><strong>Three-Layer Security Approach:</strong><br><br><strong>1. Microsoft Defender for Containers</strong><br>• Native Azure vulnerability scanning solution<br>• Automatic detection and detailed reporting<br>• Integrated with Azure Security Center<br><br><strong>2. ACR Tasks for Build Pipeline</strong><br>• Automated scanning during CI/CD process<br>• Implements shift-left security principles<br>• Catches vulnerabilities early in development<br><br><strong>3. Azure Policy for Enforcement</strong><br>• Deny deployment of unscanned images<br>• Block images with critical vulnerabilities<br>• Ensure only compliant images reach production<br><br><strong>Result:</strong> Defender scans, ACR Tasks automates, Policy enforces = Complete security pipeline","Containers,Security,ACR,Microsoft Defender,Critical Priority","Microsoft Learn - Container Security","Critical Priorities Batch"
"Azure Container Instances (ACI) scaling behavior vs AKS - what is the fundamental limitation?","ACI supports in-place auto-scaling like AKS","ACI has NO in-place auto-scaling - requires delete/redeploy","ACI supports horizontal pod autoscaling","ACI supports vertical scaling only","B","<strong>Correct Answer: B) ACI has NO in-place auto-scaling - requires delete/redeploy</strong><br><br><strong>ACI Fundamental Limitation:</strong> NO in-place auto-scaling support<br><br><strong>ACI Scaling Process:</strong><br>1. Delete the existing container group (az container delete)<br>2. Modify deployment template/command with new resource specs (CPU cores, memory GB, container count)<br>3. Redeploy the container group (az container create with updated parameters)<br><br><strong>ACI vs AKS Comparison:</strong><br>• <strong>ACI:</strong> Delete/redeploy with brief interruption<br>• <strong>AKS:</strong> In-place Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) with zero downtime<br><br><strong>Mnemonic:</strong> ACI = 'A Container, Immutable' - To change it, you must replace it entirely<br><br><strong>Exam Tip:</strong> Choose AKS for production workloads requiring auto-scaling","ACI,Scaling,Containers,Limitations,Critical Priority","Microsoft Learn - Azure Container Instances","Critical Priorities Batch"
"What are Container Apps ingress configuration options and when would you use each?","External only","Internal only","External, Internal, or Disabled based on use case","Disabled only","C","<strong>Correct Answer: C) External, Internal, or Disabled based on use case</strong><br><br><strong>External Ingress:</strong><br>• Exposes app to internet traffic<br>• Provides public FQDN (e.g., app.kindcliff-123.eastus.azurecontainerapps.io)<br>• Use for: Public-facing APIs, web applications<br><br><strong>Internal Ingress:</strong><br>• VNet-only access - no internet exposure<br>• Private connectivity within Container Apps Environment<br>• Use for: Internal microservices, backend APIs<br><br><strong>Disabled:</strong><br>• No HTTP ingress at all<br>• Use for: Background jobs, queue processors<br><br><strong>Key Configuration Points:</strong><br>• Target Port: Must match the port your container listens on (80, 8080, 3000)<br>• Traffic Splitting: Enable blue/green deployments with revision weight distribution","Container Apps,Ingress,Networking,High Priority","Microsoft Learn - Container Apps","Critical Priorities Batch"
"What does RTO (Recovery Time Objective) measure?","The replication lag between primary and secondary regions","The maximum acceptable downtime after a failure","The maximum allowed data loss window in minutes","How often backups are taken","B","RTO measures the maximum acceptable downtime after a failure. It defines how quickly systems must be restored to minimize business impact.","Storage,Disaster Recovery,RTO","Microsoft Learn - Business Continuity","RTO/RPO Storage Batch"
"What does RPO (Recovery Point Objective) represent?","How long it takes to switch to the DR site","The duration needed to restore services","The maximum tolerable data loss window","The maximum acceptable downtime after an outage","C","RPO represents the maximum tolerable data loss window.
