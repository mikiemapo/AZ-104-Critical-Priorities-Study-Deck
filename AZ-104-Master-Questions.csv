"Which feature protects against accidental deletion of blobs?","Soft delete","Immutable storage","Snapshots","GZRS","A","Soft delete retains deleted blobs for a configurable period allowing recovery. It provides protection against accidental or malicious deletion operations.","Storage,Data Protection,Soft Delete,Deletion","Microsoft Learn - Blob Storage","Storage Replication & DR Batch"
"Which feature protects against accidental modification of blobs?","ZRS","Immutable storage","Soft delete","Versioning","B","Immutable storage prevents modification or deletion of blobs for legal or compliance holds. It ensures data integrity and meets regulatory preservation requirements.","Storage,Data Protection,Immutable,Modification","Microsoft Learn - Blob Storage","Storage Replication & DR Batch"
"When designing RTO/RPO strategy, what is the FIRST step?","Choose the replication tier","Calculate storage costs","Classify business impact of data loss","Enable versioning","C","Business impact assessment drives all RTO/RPO decisions by defining tolerance levels. Cost and technology choices follow after understanding business requirements.","Storage,Strategy,Business Impact,Planning","Microsoft Learn - Disaster Recovery","Storage Replication & DR Batch"
"Which replication model should be used for low-cost workloads without HA requirements?","ZRS","GRS","LRS","GZRS","C","LRS provides the lowest cost option for non-critical workloads tolerating datacenter outages. It balances basic protection with minimal expense.","Storage,Replication,Low Cost,Requirements","Microsoft Learn - Storage Redundancy","Storage Replication & DR Batch"
"Which replication model should be used for mission-critical apps requiring zone and region protection?","LRS","ZRS","GRS","GZRS","D","GZRS delivers comprehensive protection for mission-critical applications requiring maximum availability. It combines zone redundancy with geo-replication for complete coverage.","Storage,Replication,Mission Critical,Protection","Microsoft Learn - Storage Redundancy","Storage Replication & DR Batch"
"What initiates the RTO countdown during a disaster?","The moment data replication is paused","Loss of service functionality requiring recovery","Loss of read-access to secondary region","Activation of soft delete","B","RTO timing begins when service functionality is lost and recovery becomes necessary. The clock starts when business operations are impacted, not when technical issues begin.","Storage,RTO,Disaster,Service Impact","Microsoft Learn - Disaster Recovery","Storage Replication & DR Batch"
"What is the primary purpose of RPO?","Measure data loss tolerance","Measure downtime tolerance","Determine backup frequency","Trigger failover","A","RPO specifically defines how much data loss the business can tolerate. It establishes the maximum acceptable gap between last backup and disaster occurrence.","Storage,RPO,Data Loss,Tolerance","Microsoft Learn - Disaster Recovery","Storage Replication & DR Batch"
"Which feature supports point-in-time recovery for blobs?","Immutable storage","Snapshots","RA-GZRS","ZRS","B","Snapshots capture blob state at specific moments enabling point-in-time recovery. They allow restoration to any snapshot timestamp without full backup restores.","Storage,Recovery,Snapshots,Point-in-Time","Microsoft Learn - Blob Storage","Storage Replication & DR Batch"
"Why is LRS insufficient for most production workloads?","It replicates data only within a single DC","It requires manual failover","It increases latency","It cannot store block blobs","A","LRS single-datacenter limitation creates vulnerability to facility-wide failures. Production workloads typically require protection beyond hardware-level redundancy.","Storage,Replication,LRS,Limitations","Microsoft Learn - Storage Redundancy","Storage Replication & DR Batch"
"Which replication type balances cost and durability for high availability but not DR?","ZRS","GZRS","GRS","LRS","A","ZRS provides zone-level protection at moderate cost without expensive geo-replication. It delivers high availability within a region while maintaining cost efficiency.","Storage,Replication,ZRS,Cost Balance","Microsoft Learn - Storage Redundancy","Storage Replication & DR Batch"
"Which DR strategy gives both zone fault isolation and geo-replication?","LRS","GRS","ZRS","GZRS","D","GZRS uniquely combines zone redundancy for local fault isolation with geo-replication for regional disasters. No other option provides both protection levels simultaneously.","Storage,Disaster Recovery,GZRS,Fault Isolation","Microsoft Learn - Storage Redundancy","Storage Replication & DR Batch"
