# AZ-104 Critical Priorities Study Deck

This repository contains a focused Anki deck of 30 high-priority questions designed specifically to address critical weak areas identified in AZ-104 exam performance, particularly the App Service & Containers domain (20% failure rate) and enhanced compute topics.

## About This Deck

This deck was created using analysis of quiz performance data and enhanced study materials from comprehensive Azure guides. It focuses on:

- **Critical Priority:** App Service & Containers (addressing 20% failure rate)
- **High Priority:** Enhanced compute topics including Fault Domains, Container Apps, Network Watcher
- **Medium Priority:** Core AZ-104 concepts with exam-focused scenarios
- **Strategic Coverage:** Topics identified as common exam pitfalls

## Deck Features

- **30 Targeted Questions:** Quality over quantity approach
- **Priority-Based Organization:** Critical weak areas receive primary focus
- **Rich Content:** Detailed explanations with step-by-step sequences
- **Exam-Focused:** Based on actual quiz failure patterns and Microsoft Learn content
- **HTML Formatting:** Enhanced readability with bullet points and emphasis

## How to Use

1. Import the CSV file into Anki using the included format
2. Focus first on "Critical Priority" tagged cards
3. Use spaced repetition for App Service & Containers domain
4. Practice sequence-based cards (D-G-W-C, C→A→D→B→E) until automatic

## Priority Areas Covered

### Critical Priority (App Service & Containers - 20% Failure Rate)

- Auto-swap deployment configuration
- VNet + SQL Database security sequence

### High Priority (Enhanced Compute Topics)

- Fault Domains vs Update Domains foundational knowledge
- VMSS Orchestration Modes (Uniform vs Flexible)
- Encrypted VM migration (D-G-W-C sequence)
- Network Watcher Agent deployment
- App Service runtime and OS constraints

### Medium Priority (Core AZ-104)

- VM sizing strategies and performance optimization
- Azure Backup vs Site Recovery differences
- Scaling concepts and autoscale best practices
- Deployment slots and slot-specific settings
- Monitoring stack integration
