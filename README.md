# AZ-104 Critical Priorities Study Deck

This repository contains a focused Anki deck of multiple choice questions designed specifically to address critical weak areas identified in AZ-104 exam performance, particularly the App Service & Containers domain (20% failure rate) and enhanced compute topics.

## About This Deck

This deck was created using analysis of quiz performance data and enhanced study materials from comprehensive Azure guides. It focuses on:

- **Critical Priority:** App Service & Containers (addressing 20% failure rate)
- **High Priority:** Enhanced compute topics including Fault Domains, Container Apps, Network Watcher
- **Medium Priority:** Core AZ-104 concepts with exam-focused scenarios
- **Strategic Coverage:** Topics identified as common exam pitfalls

## Deck Features

- **Multiple Choice Format:** Standard exam-style questions with 4 answer choices
- **Priority-Based Organization:** Critical weak areas receive primary focus
- **Detailed Explanations:** Step-by-step reasoning for correct answers
- **Exam-Focused:** Based on actual quiz failure patterns and Microsoft Learn content
- **Clean Formatting:** Professional styling that works perfectly in Anki
