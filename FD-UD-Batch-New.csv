"What do Fault Domains (FD) primarily protect against?","Planned maintenance events","Application patching failures","Rack, power, or network hardware failures","OS-level update reboots","C","Fault Domains protect against simultaneous hardware failures by distributing VMs across separate physical racks with independent power and network. A hardware failure in one rack only affects VMs in that specific fault domain.","VM Availability,Fault Domains,Hardware Protection,Infrastructure","Microsoft Learn - Availability Sets","VM Availability & Fault Tolerance Batch"
"What do Update Domains (UD) protect against?","Rack-level failures","Physical network switch outages","Planned maintenance that may reboot VMs","Regional datacenter failures","C","Update Domains ensure application availability during planned maintenance by isolating VMs into groups that reboot sequentially. Only one UD is updated at a time, keeping VMs in other UDs running.","VM Availability,Update Domains,Planned Maintenance,High Availability","Microsoft Learn - Planned Maintenance","VM Availability & Fault Tolerance Batch"
"How many Fault Domains are supported in most Azure regions?","Up to 20 FDs","2-3 FDs depending on region","Up to 50 FDs in large regions","1 only","B","Most Azure regions support 2-3 fault domains for hardware isolation, with newer regions typically supporting 3 FDs.

"Which domain determines how Azure spreads VMs across physical racks?","Update Domains","Fault Domains","Security Domains","Storage Domains","B","Fault Domains control VM distribution across physical hardware infrastructure including separate racks, power supplies, and network switches.

"Which domain determines how Azure sequences VM reboots during maintenance?","Disk Domains","Zone Domains","Update Domains","Fault Domains","C","Update Domains control the sequencing of VM reboots during planned Azure maintenance operations. Azure updates one UD at a time, ensuring predictable and controlled maintenance windows.","VM Availability,Update Domains,Maintenance Sequencing,Planned Maintenance","Microsoft Learn - Planned Maintenance","VM Availability & Fault Tolerance Batch"
"In an Availability Set, Azure distributes VMs across what combinations?","UDs only","FDs only","Both FDs and UDs","Fault Zones only","C","Availability Sets distribute VMs across both Fault Domains and Update Domains simultaneously for comprehensive protection. FDs provide hardware isolation while UDs ensure maintenance availability.","VM Availability,Fault Domains,Update Domains,Availability Sets","Microsoft Learn - Availability Sets","VM Availability & Fault Tolerance Batch"
"Which VMSS orchestration mode supports up to 1000 Fault Domains?","Uniform orchestration mode","Flexible orchestration mode","Availability Set mode","Zone-aware mode","B","VMSS Flexible orchestration mode supports up to 1000 fault domains for maximum spreading capability across physical infrastructure. This provides significantly greater fault isolation than Uniform mode's 5 FD limit.","VMSS,Fault Domains,Flexible Mode,Maximum Spreading","Microsoft Learn - Virtual Machine Scale Sets","VM Availability & Fault Tolerance Batch"
"Which VMSS orchestration mode supports only up to 5 Fault Domains?","Flexible mode","Single-instance VM mode","Uniform mode","Zone Redundant mode","C","VMSS Uniform orchestration mode is limited to 5 fault domains with platform-managed spreading. This mode prioritizes identical VM instances over maximum fault domain distribution.","VMSS,Fault Domains,Uniform Mode,Orchestration Limits","Microsoft Learn - Virtual Machine Scale Sets","VM Availability & Fault Tolerance Batch"
"What is the default number of Update Domains in an Availability Set?","20","3","1","5","D","The default Availability Set configuration includes 5 update domains for balanced maintenance sequencing. This can be customized up to a maximum of 20 UDs based on application requirements.","VM Availability,Update Domains,Default Configuration,Availability Sets","Microsoft Learn - Availability Sets","VM Availability & Fault Tolerance Batch"
"What do Fault Domains represent inside Azure?","Network ACLs used for VM protection","Logical groups for maintenance sequencing","Physical groupings of racks, power, and network","Sets of VM image versions","C","Fault Domains are physical groupings representing VMs that share common rack infrastructure, power source, and network switch. VMs in the same FD are vulnerable to the same hardware failure events.","VM Availability,Fault Domains,Physical Infrastructure,Hardware Isolation","Microsoft Learn - Availability Sets","VM Availability & Fault Tolerance Batch"
"When Azure performs planned maintenance, which domain ensures only some VMs reboot?","Fault Domain","Storage Domain","Update Domain","Compute Group","C","Update Domains ensure only a subset of VMs reboot during planned maintenance by grouping VMs into sequential update batches. Azure processes one UD at a time, maintaining service availability throughout maintenance.","VM Availability,Update Domains,Planned Maintenance,Sequential Updates","Microsoft Learn - Planned Maintenance","VM Availability & Fault Tolerance Batch"
"What is the key difference between Fault Domains and Update Domains?","FDs control maintenance; UDs control hardware","FDs are software-only; UDs are hardware-only","FDs protect against hardware failure; UDs protect against maintenance events","They serve identical purposes","C","Fault Domains protect against physical hardware failures (rack, power, network) while Update Domains protect against planned maintenance disruptions. Together they provide comprehensive availability coverage for different failure scenarios.","VM Availability,Fault Domains,Update Domains,Key Differences","Microsoft Learn - Availability Sets","VM Availability & Fault Tolerance Batch"
"Which scenario requires Fault Domains more than Update Domains?","Preventing OS-level patching reboots","Reducing application update impact","Surviving rack or power failure","Traffic distribution across regions","C","Surviving rack or power failures requires Fault Domain protection since FDs isolate VMs across separate physical infrastructure. Update Domains cannot protect against hardware failures, only maintenance events.","VM Availability,Fault Domains,Hardware Failures,Use Cases","Microsoft Learn - Availability Sets","VM Availability & Fault Tolerance Batch"
"Which scenario requires Update Domains more than Fault Domains?","Surviving regional power outage","Automatic scaling under load","Mitigating planned updates and maintenance restarts","Preventing NIC hardware failures","C","Mitigating planned maintenance requires Update Domain protection since UDs control sequential reboot scheduling during updates. Fault Domains cannot help during maintenance events that require coordinated VM reboots.","VM Availability,Update Domains,Planned Maintenance,Use Cases","Microsoft Learn - Planned Maintenance","VM Availability & Fault Tolerance Batch"
"If a region only supports 2 Fault Domains, how many can you configure?","Up to 5","Up to 20","You cannot increase it beyond the region limit","Only 1","C","Fault Domain limits are determined by physical datacenter infrastructure and cannot be increased beyond regional maximums. Some older regions support 2 FDs while newer regions support 3 FDs.","VM Availability,Fault Domains,Regional Limits,Infrastructure Constraints","Microsoft Learn - Availability Sets","VM Availability & Fault Tolerance Batch"
"Azure spreads VMs across Fault Domains and Update Domains when you use what feature?","VMSS Flexible Mode","Standalone VM deployment","Availability Sets","Azure Backup","C","Availability Sets automatically distribute VMs across both Fault Domains and Update Domains for comprehensive protection. Azure handles the distribution without manual configuration required.","VM Availability,Availability Sets,Automatic Distribution,FD/UD Spreading","Microsoft Learn - Availability Sets","VM Availability & Fault Tolerance Batch"
"What ensures a portion of your application stays online during sequential updates?","Fault Domains","Update Domains","Availability Groups","Scale Sets","B","Update Domains ensure application availability during sequential maintenance by keeping VMs in non-updated UDs running.
