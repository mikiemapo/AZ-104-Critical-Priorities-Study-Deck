Which Azure replication option provides the highest durability across regions?,LRS (Locally Redundant Storage),ZRS (Zone Redundant Storage),GRS (Geo-Redundant Storage),GZRS (Geo-Zone Redundant Storage),D
Which replication type keeps data within a single region but across multiple availability zones?,LRS,GRS,ZRS,GZRS,C
In GRS where is the secondary copy stored?,Same data center as primary,Same region but different zone,Region-paired secondary region,Different availability set,C
